i am curious to know what The Right Way to fix this is

its definitely possible to work around the issue with --kubelet-insecure-tls but that definitely doesnt feel like a good solution.

it seems like kube-metrics-cert expects some proper certificates for each node to exist before its added to the cluster?

after reading #196 (comment) i think i understand what the situation (i think)

tl;dr, there is a Right Way, but its kind of complicated, and leaving it insecure isn't that big of a deal

so just use --kubelet-insecure-tls

OR DONT!!

https://particule.io/en/blog/kubeadm-metrics-server/ does work!

this is basically a copy of a section in kubernetes documentation: Certificate Management with kubeadm:

    create a new cluster (though there are instructions for an existing cluster, i just made a new cluster because mine was empty) using that KubeletConfiguration thing, documented here
    kubectl certificate approve the csrs generated by kubeadm
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml without any modification to metrics-server configuration
```
